# BidirectionalVisitorCounter-8051uC
This is a low-cost microcontroller based visitor counter that can be used to know the number of persons at a place. 
For implementing the counter the microcontroller that I have used is 8051.<br /><br />Tools that were being used are:<br />
1. Keil Compiler: for writing the code and generating the output hex file.<br />
2. Proteus: for simulation of the circuit and verifying the functionality of the code.<br /><br />
The detailed design and circuit operation are described in the project report under the docs section.<br /><br />
